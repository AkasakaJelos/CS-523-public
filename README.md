Public Repo for CS-523 Projects
======================

The repo contains instructions and materials for students to do the two projects in the EPFL course CS-523 Advanced topics on privacy enhancing technologies.

## General Instructions

This README contains instructions that are common for both projects. For project-specific descriptions, please refer to [SecretStroll README](./secretstroll/README.md) and [SMCompiler README](./smcompiler/README.md) respectively. 

### Project Team Registration

Please register your 3-person team using [this form](https://forms.gle/G83QYu67Eb1zxbYk9) by March 1st. 
The team is for both projects. 

### TA Slot Booking

If you encounter some problems on the projects and would like to consult the TAs, please use [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1erESnNeBi2khQS-UP38QqR6iGraKc957w45Elz-dZ20/edit) to book a slot with TA on Fridays.

### Virtual Machines

Using a virtual machine is optional for this project. However, we provide two VM images in case your device (e.g., with Apple M1 chip) cannot install necessary dependencies for the projects: 

- [VirtualBox image for x86_64 based hardware](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pchAY6TKQNIaVJM6XRJt1CyDILJi7yzb/view?usp=share_link)

- [UTM image for ARM64 based hardware like Apple Silicon Macs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QdDnRzLMeuc0prGngXZse_vLV4HAclm_/view?usp=share_link)

**Note:** Please log in with your EPFL email to download from the above two links. The VMs support two credentials: "root:root" or "student:student".


### Submission

**SecretStroll submission deadline:** 25th April, 2024 at 23:59. 

**SMCompiler submission deadline:** 31st May, 2024 at 23:59. 

**Only 1 member per team** needs to upload their project submissions via moodle. 

In the final report of each project, there must contain a paragraph describing the contributions of each team member. Here is [an example of such a paragraph](https://www.epj.org/images/stories/faq/examples-of-author-contributions.pdf).
